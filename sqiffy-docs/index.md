features:
  - title: Versioned database schema
    details: Built-in support for schema versioning defined in your Kotlin sources reduces code repetition and risk of inaccuracies between definitions and actual database schema
  - title: Migrations
    details: Apply schema changes to the database automatically, without the need to write SQL scripts. If you prefer Liquibase, Sqiify can also generate Liquibase files.
  - title: Autogenerated type-safe Kotlin DSL
    details: Each schema definition is automatically converted into a type-safe Kotlin DSL API, which allows you to write queries in a type-safe manner.
