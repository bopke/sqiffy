# Entities

In this section we can focus a little bit more on entities and how to define them in your database schema.
You've already seen a few examples of entities in the previous sections, so let's dive deeper into the topic.
Here's an example definition of user entity:

```kotlin
const val domainPackage = "com.example.user"

typealias UserId = String

@Definition(
    domainPackage = domainPackage,
    infrastructurePackage = "$domainPackage.infra",
    apiPackage = "$domainPackage.api",
    versions = [
        DefinitionVersion(
            version = V_1_0_0,
            name = "users",
            properties = [
                Property(name = "id", type = SERIAL, mappedTo = UserId::class, default = "nanoid()"),
                Property(name = "name", type = VARCHAR, details = "16"),
            ],
            constraints = [
                Constraint(type = PRIMARY_KEY, name = "pk_id", on =["id"]),
            ],
            indices = [
                Index(type = UNIQUE_INDEX, name = "uq_name", columns = ["name"])
            ]
        ),
        DefinitionVersion(
            version = V_1_0_1,
            properties = [
                Property(operation = RETYPE, name = "name", type = VARCHAR, details = "24"),
                Property(operation = ADD, name = "display_name", type = VARCHAR, details = "48", nullable = true),
            ],
            indices = [
                Index(operation = REMOVE_INDEX, type = INDEX, name = "idx_id"),
                Index(type = INDEX, name = "idx_id", columns = ["id"])
            ]
        ),
        DefinitionVersion(
            version = V_1_0_2,
            properties = [
                Property(operation = RENAME, name = "display_name", rename = "displayName")
            ]
        )
    ]
)
object UserDefinition
```

Let's break it down. 

### Output packages

First of all, you can define output packages for generated classes:

* `domainPackage` - package for domain layer of your application
* `infrastructurePackage` - package for infrastructure layer of your application
* `apiPackage` - package for API layer of your application

This is optional, by default it generates all classes in the same package as where you've defined your `@DefinitionVersion`. 

### Serial ID

In most cases, your entities have their own autogenerated ID, that's why we're using `SERIAL` type for the `id` property.
By default, it'd be represented by auto-incremented integer.

To make this a bit more complicated, let's say we want to use custom [`nanoid()`](https://github.com/viascom/nanoid-postgres) function to generate our IDs.
Unfortunately, Sqiffy can't detect this type automatically, so we have to enforce it by using `mappedTo` parameter:

```kotlin
Property(name = "id", type = SERIAL, mappedTo = UserId::class, default = "nanoid()"),
```

The `UserId` is a type alias for `String`, and that's what Sqiffy will use to represent the `id` property in the generated API.

### Initial version

In the initial version of our schema, we have to define the table name and its properties.
